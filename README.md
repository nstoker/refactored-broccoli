## Installation

Jeopardy requires Ruby 2.6.6 to run, I'd recommend running the following if you don't have it installed:

### RVM + Ruby prerequisites

Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) then install Ruby 2.6.6, we will do something similar for the clixifix application.

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm install ruby-2.6.6
rvm use 2.6.6
```

### Installing Dependancies

Pull down the codebase and install all key dependancies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clixifix/jeopardy.git
cd jeopardy
bundle install
```

## Boot the server

If you're editing anything other than `./views/` files, you'll need to restart the webserver for changes to take effect by doing CTRL + C and rerun

```bash
cd jeopardy
ruby app.rb
```
